## Drupal Patch Review OpenShift Client

This is a setup script for use with the Drupal Patch Review application.

This particular set of scripts is intended to be used on a Red Hat OpenShift environment. http://openshift.redhat.com.

** Broken **
This is currently broken since OpenShift currently runs php 5.3.3 which isn't supported by Drupal 8.x. Will re-visit in the future.
